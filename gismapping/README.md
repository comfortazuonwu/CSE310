# Overview



{Provide a description the map software that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  Describe the source of the data that you used.}
I did a simple website map displaying trails in the Santa Monica area. I used the ArcGIS library API for javascript.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I love the outdoors and I wanted other people to be able to get information on the trails that are located close to them. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
