# Overview

This is a project on data analysis and I used pandas to analyze a dataset.

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}
I used a cars dataset to see where most of the cars where made, the model, mpg, horspower etc.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
I wanted to know whhere most cars where made and also see their mpg from 1970-1982

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
